## Frontend QA - Code Challenge
The main objective of this assignment is measuring frontend (web) automation & QA engineering skills. 

## Scenario to be automated:
Scenario details will be be shared over Email. 

## Conditions:
- Code challenge to be done using Cypress / Javascript preferably. In case of any concerns or want to use different tool, please communicate to us.
- For automated tests, assertions are the key. We want you to explore the scenario and add the assertions in code by yourself.
- Follow best practices for coding & automation (OOP, POM, reusable, clean, documented code).
- Report generation for executed scripts.


## What we are looking for:
A code we can Trust!

This code is meant for testing, and passed execution does not mean working application; maybe testing code needs to be tested in the first place.

## Important points related to Delivery:
- Code challenge should be delivered as a link to a public git repository (github.com or bitbucket.com are preferred). 
- Implementations focusing on **quality over feature completeness** will be highly appreciated.  Donâ€™t feel compelled to implement everything, while compromising on code quality. 
- Even if you are not able to complete the challenge, please do submit it anyways.
